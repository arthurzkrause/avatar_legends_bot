    #The Four Nations
    "four nations":"Earth Kingdom\n• The Earth Kingdom is the largest nation and has the most varied landscape. From scorching deserts, to frozen mountains, to rolling hills, to balmy beaches. How people in the Earth Kingdom contend with its nature is dependent on the region. Larger Earth Kingdom cities are marvels of architecture and technology no matter what era you visit them in. However, many areas suffer from poor infrastructure; the Kingdom is too large—and the leaders often too corrupt—for full oversight and development of poorer regions\n\nAir Nomads ou Air Nation\n• The Air Nomads (or Air Nation in the Korra Era) are a nomadic people, but have four temples located at the edges of the map, each named after the four cardinal directions: north, south, east, and west. Most Air Nomad temples are located in high, rocky locations that are hard to reach for anyone except Airbenders, sky bison, and other flying creatures. Though the temples are built in mountainous areas, they are far from devoid of life, with many pockets of beautiful greenery and ancient trees welcoming any number of local species.\n\nWater Tribes\n• The Water Tribes primarily exist in the frigid North and South poles. Both poles are frozen landscapes where snow, sleet, and freezing temperatures are the norm. Little grows in either pole and the tribespeople hunt, forage, and trade for sustenance. Snowy mountains dot both the North and South and both tribes use the sea as a primary mode of transportation between different towns and villages. The Foggy Swamp tribespeople are an exception to their waterbending cousins, inhabiting a damp, warm swamp within the Earth Kingdom where strong spiritual energy (and water) ties them to the impressive flora in the area\n\nFire Nation\n• The Fire Nation is a series of islands to the west of the Earth Kingdom with numerous volcanoes. The climate ranges from pleasantly warm to scorching hot with many beautiful tropical beaches to visit on the various islands. Many of the Fire Nation volcanoes between the mountainous regions of the islands are active in every era. The warm weather suits the nation's Firebenders just fine and over the years inventors have developed many different ships for people to navigate between the islands.",
  
    #The Trainings
    "waterbending":"Water is movement, change, and grace. The element cannot be broken and even in its most rigid forms has the ability to melt and reform. It is a dynamic element, subtle but powerful. Waterbending is inspired by the real-world martial art Tai Chi. This style's flowing motions allow a Waterbender to use their element defensively to redirect an opponent's attack, or offensively in the form of water whips, ice attacks, or large waves. Certain Waterbenders can also redirect energy paths in the body to heal injuries.",
  
    "earthbending":"Earth is strong, stable, and constant. The element stands the test of time; it is a steady element, bold and unyielding. Earthbending is inspired by the real-world Hung Ga, known for solid stances and blunt punches, with fists formed into diverse shapes and toughened by striking exercises. Earthbenders can harness the formative energy of the earth, powerfully punch boulders, and ride platforms of stone to impossible heights.",
  
    "firebending":"Fire is pure energy, destruction, and regeneration. The element can either consume everything around it in a powerful blaze, or heat it with a brilliant intensity that is impossible to ignore. It is an energetic element, bright and mighty. Firebending is inspired by the real-world Northern Shaolin, associated with the Shaolin Monastery. These fighters use fast, athletic movements including jumps, spins, and extended linear stances, powered by breath. Firebenders can exhale f ire, wield flames like daggers, and grow a singular flame into a raging bonfire.",
   
    "airbending":"Air is flexible, playful, but still powerful. The element goes where it wills and expands and contracts to meet its environment. Air is an open element, breeding freedom and bolstering spirits. Airbending is loosely based on the real-world Baguazhang. The martial art's circular motions and footwork allows one person to defend against multiple enemies. Airbenders are quick and nimble using their skills to defend from and evade attacks. Airbenders can ride balls of spinning air, quell cyclones, and sweep even the heaviest objects into weightlessness.",
   
    "weapons":"Weapons are precise, intimidating, and fierce. They demand craftsmanship to create and discipline to master. In the right hands, a weapon can level the playing field between a non-bender and a bender. Fighters trained in the use of weapons can come from any nation. Their first specialty likely comes from their home nation with a weapon and fighting style unique to their home region, but it can also include unarmed combat such as chi-blocking. Weapons in the Avatarverse take inspiration from real world Asian and Indigenous cultures, such as the Chinese dao (saber) and other traditional weapons.",
    "technology":"Technology is brilliance, power, and innovation. It changes what is possible and pushes the boundaries of established norms. It is intricate, yet mighty. Technological innovation can be found throughout the Four Nations; heroes who use technology spring up all over the world. Of course, advanced technology varies by the era—an Earth Kingdom technologist in the Roku Era might use smoke bombs and traps, whereas a technologist in the Korra Era might use an electrified rod or mechanized vehicles!\n\nThe Kyoshi Era\nA bronze single-shot hand cannon made with Fire Nation explosives. A rudder designed for steering larger vessels, allowing the Water Tribes to dominate the oceans. An extensive collection of building plans made by Air Nomads on their travels to other nations.\n\nThe Roku Era\n A steam-powered Fire Nation ship. Alchemical herbs foraged from the Foggy Swamp and turned into healing balms. A portable water pump to put a dampener on a Firebender's plans.\n\nThe Hundred Year War\n A steam-powered Fire Nation dirigible.Medicinal curatives to compensate for the lack of Water Tribe healers. Goggles allowing the wearer to see things at great distances and extremely close-up.\n\nThe Aang Era\nGenerators to propel newer, larger pieces of machinery. A gas-powered snowmobile to race between the slopes of the Southern Water Tribe. An electric lamp to brighten the deepest badger-mole tunnels.\n\nThe Korra Era\nA speedy motorcycle to zip through the roads of Republic City. An electrified baton to fend off Triad members. A portable camera to capture special moments.",
   
    #CORE ELEMENTS
    "fatigue":"Every companion has a fatigue track with five boxes on it. When you mark fatigue, it represents getting physically, mentally, and/or emotionally tired, stressed, and worn down. If you've marked all five fatigue boxes, then any time a game rule gives you the choice between marking fatigue or doing something else, you have to do the something else.\n\nAfter you've marked all five fatigue boxes and have another fatigue mark, you have a condition marked:\n• Afraid, take -2 to intimidate and call someone out\n• Angry, take -2 to guide and comfort and assess a situation\n• Guilty, take -2 to push your luck and +2 to deny a callout\n• Insecure, take -2 to trick and resist shifting your balance\n• Troubled, take -2 to plead and rely on your skills or training.\n• Afraid: run from danger or difficulty.\n\nTo clear a conditions:\n• Angry: break something important or lash out at a friend.\n• Guilty: make a personal sacrifice to absolve your guilt.\n• Insecure: take foolhardy action without talking to your companions.\n• Troubled: seek guidance from a mentor or powerful figure",

    "background":"*Military\n• You trained to fight as a soldier in a military unit such as a mercenary company, a regional militia, or a state government's standing army. Are you a soldier, sailor, or spy? Do you still answer to your commanding officer, or have you gone rogue?\nExamples: Kyoshi Warriors, Iroh, Kuvira\n\nMonastic\n• You are or were a monk, nun, or acolyte of a particular order. Perhaps you were devoted to finding enlightenment or helping others in a community with other like-minded devotees, or perhaps you were committed to scholastic rituals and bureaucratic traditions. What is your order's goal? What are its rules? In what ways did your upbringing agree with you, and in what ways did you long for something different?\nExamples: Avatar Aang, Fire Sage Shyu, Gyatso\n\nOutlaw\n• You live outside the bounds of law and order as a criminal, insurrectionist, or pirate. Were you born into the lawless life, or did you come into it later on? Did you choose the outlaw life, or did the outlaw life choose you? Do you work alone or with a gang? Whom have you hurt just to stay alive?\nExamples: Flying Opera Company, Jet and the Freedom Fighters, Tokuga\n\nPrivileged\n• You grew up in the lap of luxury, wealth, or prestige as a hereditary aristocrat, prominent merchant, or even the heir to a successful crime family. What advantages did your upbringing give you? Now that you're no longer surrounded by safety and ease, what do you miss—and what do you fear?\nExamples: Asami, Zuko, the Beifong family\n\nUrban\n• You grew up running the streets of a big city like the Northern Water Tribe capital, Yu Dao, or Republic City. You rub shoulders with people from many different walks of life, and you might not feel so at home if your journey takes you to the wilderness. What unexpected skills and knowledge do you have from city life? Which urban amenities do you miss—and which hardships do you not miss?\nExamples: King Bumi, Bolin, Jargala\n\nWilderness\n• You grew up in a town or household surrounded by nature, the elements in their most raw form, and developed advanced survival skills because of it. Which terrain makes you feel at home? What special skill are you most proud of—perhaps orienteering, herbalism, sailing, or animal training? What excites you, and what scares you, about big-city adventures?\nExamples: Avatar Korra, Lek, Katara",
    
    "stats":"Creativity\n• Measures your ability to think quickly and unconventionally, to come up with surprising plans or breathtaking art. Avatar Aang, Satoru, and Asami Satō all have strong Creativity.\n\nFocus\n• Measures your character's ability to perform difficult or precise tasks under pressure, to shut out distractions and work in a patient, disciplined, or stubborn manner. Rangi, Princess Azula, and Tenzin all have strong Focus.\n\nHarmony\n• Measures your character's social sensitivity, care, and empathy, their aptitude at taking into account the views and feelings of others and acting in an honest and compassionate way. Katara, Uncle Iroh, and Zaheer all have strong Harmony.\n\nPassion\n• Measures the intensity of your character's emotions and drive, and how good they are at listening to their feelings and turning them into decisive action.

They may clear a condition or 2-fatigue, and you may ask one question; they must answer honestly.\n• They shut you down. They inflict a condition on you, and you shift their balance in response. On a 10+, if they embrace your guidance and comfort, you may also shift their balance.",

On a miss, they can demand you act in accordance with one of your principles instead; mark a condition or act as they request.\n\nDeny a Callout:\nWhen you deny an NPC calling on you to live up to your principle, roll with that principle. On a hit, act as they say or mark 1-fatigue. On a 10+, their words hit hard; you must also shift your balance towards the called-on principle. On a miss, you stand strong; clear a condition, clear 1-fatigue, or shift your balance, your choice. If you deny a callout, then you want to roll low, not high\n\nResist Shifting Your Balance:\nWhen you resist an NPC shifting your balance, roll without a modifier. On a hit, you maintain your current balance in spite of their words or deeds. On a 10+, choose two. On a 7-9, choose one.\n• Clear a condition or mark growth by immediately acting to prove them wrong\n• Shift your balance towards the opposite principle\n• Learn what their principle is (if they have one); if you already know, take +1 forward against them On a miss, they know just what to say to throw you off balance. Mark a condition, and the GM shifts your balance twice.\n\nLose Your Balance:\nIf your balance shifts past the end of the track, you lose your balance. You obsess over that principle to a degree that's not healthy for you or anyone around you. Choose one of the following:\n• Give in or submit to your opposition\n• Lose control of yourself in a destructive and harmful way\n• Take an extreme action in line with the principle, then flee Afterward, when you've had some time to recover and recenter yourself, shift your center one step towards the principle you exceeded and clear all your conditions and fatigue.
